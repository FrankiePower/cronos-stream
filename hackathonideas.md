### Summary of All Projects from the x402 Hackathon (Ethereum/Base Edition)

Based on Austin Griffith's thread from January 13, 2026 (the Ethereum/Base-focused x402 Hackathon), he highlighted his personal "standout winning projects" as the top submissions. The event was a no-cash-prize, mentorship-driven hackathon (Dec 8, 2025 – Jan 5, 2026) aimed at building infrastructure and tools for the x402 protocol—an HTTP-based micropayment standard for APIs, AI agents, and machine-to-machine economies on Ethereum/Base.

Austin didn't list *every* submission (the hackathon site doesn't publicly catalog them all), but he spotlighted these as winners for addressing key challenges like refunds, trust minimization, efficiency, streaming, routing, proxying, and escrows. I've compiled them below from the full thread, including names, builders, brief descriptions, and links where provided. For completeness, I've also noted additional projects mentioned in thread replies or related X posts as "honorable mentions/submissions" (these weren't called "winners" by Austin but were part of the ecosystem buzz).

#### Standout Winning Projects (Austin's Picks)
These are the ones he explicitly praised as top-tier infra builds:

| Project Name | Builder(s) | Description | Links/Repos |

| Route402 | @f0rr0 (Sid Jain, @D3ServeLabs) | A router for x402 payments. Dynamically routes requests to different facilitators based on rules (e.g., downtime, price tiers) without code changes. Unified API for reliability. | [GitHub: labs-route-402](https://github.com/d3servelabs/labs-route-402), [Demo Video](https://x.com/f0rr0/status/2007063382692884614) |
| 402 Proxy | @SamyMishal (@D3ServeLabs, @namefi_io) | Proxy wrapper for existing endpoints. Turns free APIs into x402 paywalls with minimal setup; no major code changes needed. | [Demo Site](https://labs-x402-proxy.vercel.app), [Short Demo](https://loom.com/share/d03c43126c3643489b2d496638477e28), [Full Demo](https://loom.com/share/4096df69bf684908b6861fbe2eea6292), [Post](https://x.com/SamyMishal/status/2007856978719293722) |
| x402-escrow | @PIsajeski (Panche, @agentokratia) | Session-based escrow facilitator for x402. Deposit once with a gasless signature for unlimited high-frequency calls (e.g., agent-to-agent); bounded exposure to reduce per-request overhead. | [GitHub: x402-escrow](https://github.com/Agentokratia/x402-escrow), [npm: @agentokratia/x402-escrow](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@agentokratia/x402-escrow), [Live: facilitator.agentokratia.com](http://facilitator.agentokratia.com), [Demo Video](https://x.com/PIsajeski/status/2008295531458556064) |

These projects collectively advance x402 by tackling gas costs, trust, scalability, and agent economies. Austin encouraged starring repos and building on them—check [x402hackathon.com](https://www.x402hackathon.com/) for resources.
